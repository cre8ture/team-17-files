I am not what I am

The Moor is of a free and open nature
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by th’ nose
As asses are.

Men should be what they seem,
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

All that glisters is not gold

One may smile, and smile, and be a villain.

There’s daggers in men’s smiles’; ‘Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile’; ‘Some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, millions of mischief.

So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.
Only in this disguise I think't no sin
To cosen him that would unjustly win.
