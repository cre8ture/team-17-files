False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.

Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep.

For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright, who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse,
For I mine own gained knowledge should profane
If I would time expend with such a snipe
But for my sport and profit. 

So will I turn her virtue into pitch
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all
