The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords, in such a just and charitable war.

I feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities, a still and quiet conscience.

In peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.

A peace is of the nature of a conquest; for then both parties nobly are subdued, and neither party loser.

Corruption wins not more than honesty. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, To silence envious tongues.
