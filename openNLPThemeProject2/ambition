Two truths are told
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of th’imperial theme 

Thou wouldst be great
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it

I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself
And falls on th’other

To be thus is nothing, but to be safely thus

Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.

Great minds have purposes; others have wishes.

Big results require big ambitions.

Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.
