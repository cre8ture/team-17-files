Corruption wins not more than honesty.

I hate ingratitude more in a man than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood

Corruption wins not more than honesty. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, To silence envious tongues.

When rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will

Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
And loathsome canker lies in sweetest bud.
All men make faults.

Love thyself last, cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.

What wouldst thou do, old man?
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows?
